# Metabolites Mediation Analysis

- Metabolites are already transformed by logarithm function.

### Medation analysis steps
- Step 1 is already done by GWAS.
- Step 2 is done.
- Step 3 is done.
- Step 1, 2, 3 were merged.
- First summary of the 3 steps of the mediation analysis was reported to Cristian on 29-Nov-2022.
- When trying to replicate the achieved results on 29-Nov-22, I realized that log transformation affected association between the replicated variants and the metabolites in step 3 of mediation analysis, thus leading not to be able to replicate the significant relation between the CASZ1 variants and alpha_AAA metabolite in step 3. So, at the end we did not have any mediator for kidney function. Let's check it gaian with the PI (28-Jan-2023).
